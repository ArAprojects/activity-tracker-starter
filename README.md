# Activity Tracker

This is a 'Fit-Bit'-like activity, sleep, and hydration tracker. It takes data from 50 randomly generated users from 4 cetagories (personal data, hydration data, sleep data, and activity data), manipulates the information, and displays the requested data in a fashonable and elegant manner.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo.
2. Set up the dependancies by running `npm install`
3. Start playing around with the software.

### Prerequisites

You'll need a modern windows, linux, or OS X machine.

## Running the tests

There are a comprehensive set of mocha/chai tests for all classes, properties, and methods.

Set up the dependancies by running `npm install`

Run tests by typing `mocha` in your terminal in your cloned directory.

# Activity Tracker

This is a 'Fit-Bit'-like activity, sleep, and hydration tracker. It takes data from 50 randomly generated users from 4 cetagories (personal data, hydration data, sleep data, and activity data), manipulates the information, and displays the requested data in a fashonable and elegant manner.

There are a comprehensive set of mocha/chai tests for all classes, properties, and methods.

Run tests by typing `mocha` in your terminal in your cloned directory.
